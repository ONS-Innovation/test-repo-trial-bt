# ADR 0001: Package Manager Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For Python projects, there are several package managers available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The main options considered were:

1. **pip** with requirements.txt - The standard Python package manager
2. **Poetry** - Modern dependency management with lockfile support
3. **Pipenv** - Virtual environment and dependency management
4. **Conda** - Cross-platform package manager, especially for data science
5. **PDM** - Modern Python package manager with PEP 582 support

## Decision

We have selected **Poetry** as our package manager for this project.

## Rationale

Poetry was chosen for the following reasons:

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Poetry provides robust dependency resolution to avoid conflicts.
2. **Lockfile Support**: Poetry.lock ensures reproducible builds across environments.
3. **Virtual Environment Management**: Integrated virtual environment handling.
4. **Modern Workflow**: Poetry offers a modern, intuitive CLI for managing packages.
5. **Growing Adoption**: Increasing adoption in the Python community, especially for library development.
6. **Project Metadata**: Single pyproject.toml file for project configuration.
7. **Build System**: Integrated build system for creating distributable packages.
8. **ONS Standards**: Aligns with ONS recommendations for modern Python development.

## Consequences

- All team members will need to be familiar with Poetry.
- CI/CD pipelines will be configured to use Poetry.
- Documentation will include Poetry-specific commands.
- The project structure will follow Poetry conventions.

## Alternatives Considered

### pip with requirements.txt
- **Pros**: Simple, standard, widely understood
- **Cons**: No lockfile by default, no built-in virtual environment management

### Conda
- **Pros**: Excellent for data science, handles non-Python dependencies
- **Cons**: Overkill for many projects, slower than alternatives

### PDM
- **Pros**: Modern features, PEP 582 support
- **Cons**: Less adoption, newer tool with potential stability concerns
