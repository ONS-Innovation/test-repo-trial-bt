# ADR 0003: Testing Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Effective testing is critical for ensuring code quality and reliability. We needed to select a testing framework that would:

1. Support both unit and integration testing
2. Provide clear test reports and failure information
3. Support test parameterisation and fixtures
4. Integrate well with our CI/CD pipeline
5. Have good community support and documentation

## Decision

We have selected **pytest** as our testing framework, along with the following complementary tools:

1. **pytest-cov** - For code coverage reporting
2. **pytest-xdist** - For parallel test execution

## Rationale

### pytest

Pytest was chosen as our testing framework because:

1. **Simplicity**: Tests are written as standard Python functions, making them easy to write and understand
2. **Fixtures**: Powerful fixture system for test setup and dependency injection
3. **Parameterisation**: Easy parameterisation of tests for multiple test cases
4. **Assertions**: Rich assertion introspection without needing special assertion methods
5. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Large ecosystem of plugins for extending functionality
6. **Community**: Strong community support and documentation
7. **Compatibility**: Works well with other testing tools and CI/CD systems

### pytest-cov

pytest-cov was selected for code coverage because:

1. **Integration**: Seamless integration with pytest
2. **Reporting**: Multiple report formats (terminal, HTML, XML)
3. **Configuration**: Configurable coverage thresholds

### pytest-xdist

pytest-xdist was chosen for parallel test execution because:

1. **Speed**: Significantly reduces test execution time
2. **Resource Utilization**: Better utilizes multi-core systems
3. **Integration**: Works well with pytest and other plugins

## Consequences

- All tests will be written using the pytest framework
- CI/CD pipelines will use pytest for test execution
- Code coverage requirements will be enforced through pytest-cov
- Test execution will be parallelized where possible
- Documentation will include guidance on writing effective pytest tests

## Alternatives Considered

### unittest (Standard Library)

- **Pros**: No additional dependencies, part of the standard library
- **Cons**: More verbose test syntax, less powerful fixture system, fewer features

### nose2

- **Pros**: Extension of unittest with additional features
- **Cons**: Less active development, smaller community than pytest

### Hypothesis

- **Pros**: Property-based testing with powerful generators
- **Cons**: Different paradigm that requires learning new concepts, better as a complement to pytest than a replacement
