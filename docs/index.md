# test-repo-trial-bt Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the test-repo-trial-bt project.

## Overview

test-repo-trial-bt

This project follows the Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) methodology, which emphasizes:

- Reproducibility: Anyone can run the code and get the same results
- Automation: Minimizing manual steps in the data processing workflow
- Version Control: All code changes are tracked
- Testing: Automated tests ensure code quality and correctness
- Documentation: Clear documentation of code, processes, and decisions

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure for RAP projects:

## Getting Started

See the [README.md](../README.md) for instructions on how to get started with this project.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for code linting and formatting. The configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.

### Type Checking

Static type checking is performed using [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/). Type annotations should be used for all function parameters and return values.

### Testing

Tests are written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). The project aims for high test coverage, with both unit and end-to-end tests.

### Documentation

- Code should be well-documented with docstrings
- Significant architectural decisions should be documented in ADRs
- User-facing documentation should be clear and comprehensive

## Architectural Decisions

See the [ADR directory](./adr/index.md) for documentation on architectural decisions made in this project.
